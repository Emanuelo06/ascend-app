# Goals & Challenges System - Backend Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the complete backend implementation of the Goals & Challenges system for ASCEND, following the goals-first architecture where every habit, challenge, AI suggestion, and metric is derived from and mapped to user goals.

## 🎯 Core Principles Implemented

- **Goals-first**: Every habit must belong to a goal (via `goal_habits` mapping)
- **Actionable**: Goals translate to micro-challenges and measurable habits automatically
- **Human-centered**: Soft language, encouraging, avoid shaming
- **Data-linked**: Every suggestion cites evidence from actual user data
- **Progress visible**: Clear progress percentages, milestones, and ETAs
- **AI-guided**: Personalized suggestions from AI + rules engine
- **Composable**: Goals can have sub-goals and challenges (micro-quests)
- **Privacy & opt-in**: Social features and AI data use are opt-in

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables

## ⚙️ Backend Jobs & Logic

### 1. Nightly Rollup Job (`/api/admin/goal-rollup`)

**Purpose**: Calculate goal progress, update health indicators, create snapshots

**Process**:
1. Fetch all active goals for user(s)
2. For each goal:
   - Calculate progress from mapped habits using weights
   - Compute momentum vs previous week
   - Calculate health (green/yellow/red) based on consistency and momentum
   - Create/update weekly snapshot
   - Update goal progress and health
   - Trigger AI suggestions if needed

**Progress Calculation Formula**:
```sql
For each habit mapped to goal:
  habitScore = (actualOccurrences / expectedOccurrences) * 100
  weightedScore += habitScore * weight
  totalWeight += weight

progress_pct = weightedScore / totalWeight
```

**Health Rules**:
- Green: EMA30 ≥ 0.8 AND momentum ≥ -5%
- Yellow: EMA30 0.6-0.79 OR momentum -20% to -5%
- Red: EMA30 < 0.6 OR momentum < -20%

### 2. AI Suggestion Triggers

**When AI suggestions are generated**:
- Progress drops > 20% vs previous week
- Goal health becomes "red"
- Very low progress (< 30%)
- User requests suggestions

**Suggestion Types**:
- `move_time` - Change habit timing
- `change_dose` - Adjust habit intensity
- `micro_challenge` - Create short-term challenge
- `new_habit` - Suggest new supporting habit
- `accountability` - Invite accountability partner

### 3. Challenge Lifecycle Management

**States**: planned → running → completed/failed

**Automatic Transitions**:
- Start: User initiates challenge
- Complete: All required tasks completed within duration
- Fail: Missed threshold (configurable, e.g., miss 3 days total)

**XP Rewards**: Automatic XP awarding on challenge completion
